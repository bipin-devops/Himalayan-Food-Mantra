This figure illustrates the optimum utilization of tools and techniques in designing wireframes. This design resembles the pictorial approach of flows in the project. The applications used to design those wireframes are Photoshop and Sketch app. However, the links on the pictures are generated by using sketch app that has a function to create the artboard and link it with points with the next appropriate artboard.

# Implementation

## Tools and Technologies Used

There are several tools and techniques that are used in construction of the web application. Building of frontend designs and layout completely varies from the backend ideas and logics. Database queries and storing and retrieval of the data as per the demand requires various logical implementations. For the development of Himalayan Food Mantra, the following tools and techniques were used.

| **Analysis and Design Phase** |                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| - UML tools                   | draw.io, Enterprise Architect    |
| - Database Design tool        | DB visualizer                    |
| **Project Methodology**       |                                  |
| - Methodology used            | Agile methodology                |
| - Project planning            | Scrum                            |
| **Designing Phase**           |                                  |
| - UI tools                    | Adobe Photoshop                  |
| - UX tools                    | Adobe XD                         |
| **Development Phase**         |                                  |
| - Programming language        | PHP Laravel.                     |
| - Front end Language          | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap |
| - IDE                         | Visual Studio Code               |
| - Database                    | MySQL                            |

## System Architecture

As we used Laravel framework of PHP as programming language while implementing the web application, it provides the implementation of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. In MVC architecture, Model represents the class for each of the tables that were created in the database, and it interacts with View and Controller to perform different operations within the system. View is the User Interface that users can view through the browser. The controller is responsible to get the input from the users and can interact with views and model to process the user’s input.

## Implementation Process

The implementation of the web application is broken into three steps.

- Frontend Implementation
- Backend Implementation
- Integration of Frontend and Backend

# Limitations

There are a few limitations towards which the system has yet to work. They are as follows:

- The application could have supported the multi-language functionality as not every global user is comfortable with the use of English language.
- The application stores its information regarding client, and other payment records in cloud which cannot be trusted to be fully secured in case of any accident or cyber-attacks.
- The real-time status of the order cannot be provided to the customers.
- The credit card payment system is still left unimplemented.
- Tracking of the delivery can be done using GPS tracking system on delivery vehicle.
- The web application could not provide the mechanism of printing the dockets after receiving the order.

By ensuring that all these limitations are well understood, and all the prevailing risks are mitigated for the overall well-functioning of the web application so that it proves productive for both customer as well as admin and hotel staffs.
